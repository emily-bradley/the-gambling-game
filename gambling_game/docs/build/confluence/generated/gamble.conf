<p>This is the Gamble class. Gamble is a game, involving a set of Agents and a set of Bandits. Agents are rewarded each round, based on  the reward probability of the Bandit they select. The Agent with the most rewards at the end of the game (i.e. when all rounds are complete) is the winner.</p><p style="font-weight: bold; margin-top: 30px">Classes</p>
